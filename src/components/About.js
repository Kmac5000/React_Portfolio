      <hr />
      <p>
        I was born in hospital in Florida, But I was moved to Colorado at the
        age of 2.
      </p>
      <p>I have an extensive history in Art and Truck Driving.</p>
      <p>
        Since I have begun coding I have realized I really love the Front End
        Design side.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can help a company improve the look feel and functionality of their
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am great with react, and css, and have lots of experience with design.
      </p>
